# 100 - Problem Mapping

Based on [Problem Mapping: Every Problem Needs A Story](https://www.overlapassociates.com/ideas/designing-with-purpose-the-art-of-problem-mapping).

Problem mapping is an exercise in empowerment. It provides us with a way to design solutions and understand how those solutions change the problem, where we need to back-up and take a different route, or who else we need to involve in the problem solving process. This is the first in a three part series exploring how problem mapping can help us unravel complex challenges.

Overlap is a problem solving company. We’ve been refining our approach to innovative design for over 15 years, focusing on creating positive change, and transforming systems, services, and experiences for the better. It’s a lot like detective work, meticulously examining every clue to solve the mystery. It’s deeply human, highly creative, effective, and optimistic. We use problem maps as a powerful tool that makes sense of chaos and complexity by breaking down a problem into manageable pieces.

## 100 - Understanding Problem Mapping

Imagine yourself in a dense forest with no clear path ahead. The trees obstruct your way, and you’re uncertain about the direction to take. That’s how complex problems can seem—overwhelming and disorienting. By breaking down a problem, we’re able to better understand who is impacted, what those impacts are, and where we can focus our energy to create human-centred solutions. Let’s break this down even further:

Problem mapping consists of three phases: identifying obstacles, crafting problem statements, and exploring symptoms and causes.

Check out the visual prototype of a Problem Map Outline below. Imagine each square is a sticky note with an obstacle or insight from you or your team. In this blog, we’re exploring how identifying obstacles and clarifying narratives (Step 1 and Step 2 below) lays the foundations for better solutions. (Don’t worry, we’ll get to the fun, colourful stuff next!)

## 200 - Gaining Empathy for People Involved

Empathy serves as the guiding compass for problem mapping. It helps us in comprehending the needs, desires, and pain points of the people directly affected by the problem. We believe that engaging with the individuals directly connected to the problem will enhance our understanding, but the end-user perspective is only one of many. Always seek out other groups or individuals linked to the problem—bringing in diverse perspectives and unpacking a shared understanding of the problem will enrich it even further.
