# 300 - The First Step: Identifying Obstacles and Challenges

When we map components of a complex problem, we start by examining the obstacles in front of us. To reach our destination, it helps to have a list of the hurdles we know we need to overcome. In design, we call this phase “Discovery.” We collect insights, data, and perspectives to gain a deep understanding of the actual problem at hand. We do this by engaging the people affected by the problem, asking them to share their lived experiences and perspectives. At this stage, we want to focus in on the actual obstacles getting in the way of a better future state, not the things we think could go wrong.

## 100 - Look for Connections: The Stories of the Problem

We find the most effective way to explore these diverse perspectives is to group them based on connections or relationships. Critical thinking and deep discussion is crucial at this stage (we sometimes call this “sensemaking”).We encourage people to envision a collection of ideas as a narrative about the problem. It helps us get beyond merely grouping similar ideas into categories, and see the complexity of the different perspectives at play. We’re not looking to exclude any ideas or viewpoints here! The purpose of connecting perspectives is to paint a full picture of the problem, and increase buy-in from everyone involved.

## 200 - Speak It into Existence

Or at the very least, write it down. The final step in the initial phase of this process is to give your clusters a name. What story are all of these obstacles telling? This step is important because it creates a moment of consensus and is an act of creativity. You’re combining everyone’s perspectives into something new that didn’t exist before—and it’s often a deeply satisfying moment.

## 300 - The Power of Problem Mapping

Problem mapping empowers us to view complex challenges in a fresh light. By breaking them down into smaller, manageable components, we find clarity and focus. Moreover, we uncover new connections, narrow in on the specific parts of the problem that need our attention, or unearth new insights. A problem map is an asset you can revisit, test ideas against, and use to guide your journey to a solution.

In the next chapter of our series, we’ll turn our discovered insights into problem statements. Problem statements guide our design process and lead us to better potential solutions.
