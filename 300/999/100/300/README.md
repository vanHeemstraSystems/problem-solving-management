# 300 - The First Step: Identifying Obstacles and Challenges

When we map components of a complex problem, we start by examining the obstacles in front of us. To reach our destination, it helps to have a list of the hurdles we know we need to overcome. In design, we call this phase “Discovery.” We collect insights, data, and perspectives to gain a deep understanding of the actual problem at hand. We do this by engaging the people affected by the problem, asking them to share their lived experiences and perspectives. At this stage, we want to focus in on the actual obstacles getting in the way of a better future state, not the things we think could go wrong.

## 100 - Look for Connections: The Stories of the Problem

We find the most effective way to explore these diverse perspectives is to group them based on connections or relationships. Critical thinking and deep discussion is crucial at this stage (we sometimes call this “sensemaking”).We encourage people to envision a collection of ideas as a narrative about the problem. It helps us get beyond merely grouping similar ideas into categories, and see the complexity of the different perspectives at play. We’re not looking to exclude any ideas or viewpoints here! The purpose of connecting perspectives is to paint a full picture of the problem, and increase buy-in from everyone involved.
