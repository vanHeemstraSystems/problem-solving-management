# 600 - The Fourth Step: Identifying Symptoms

Based on [Understanding Symptoms and Causes: Creating Comprehensive Problem Maps for Better Design](https://www.overlapassociates.com/ideas/creating-comprehensive-problem-maps).

Welcome back to the final part of our problem mapping series! In this last chapter, we’ll deepen our understanding of complex challenges by exploring symptoms and causes. This step really helps with developing solutions. Understanding of what’s actually causing the problem is critical to solving it. Moreover, it helps us get clear on whether our solution is a band aid or a cure. 

## 100 - Recap of Problem Mapping

In the first two parts of our series, we introduced problem mapping and learned the art of crafting powerful problem statements. Now, we’ll complete our map with an exploration of symptoms and causes.

In problem mapping, it’s important to understand the distinction between symptoms and causes. Symptoms are like signals indicating that something is amiss. They are the visible manifestations of an underlying problem. Causes on the other hand are like the roots of a tree. They’re hidden beneath the surface, but driving the visible symptoms. By understanding both, we end up with a holistic view of the problem.
