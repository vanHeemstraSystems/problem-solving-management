# 400 - The Second Step: Clustering Problems

## 100 - Speak It into Existence

Or at the very least, write it down. The final step in the initial phase of this process is to give your clusters a name. What story are all of these obstacles telling? This step is important because it creates a moment of consensus and is an act of creativity. You’re combining everyone’s perspectives into something new that didn’t exist before—and it’s often a deeply satisfying moment.

## 200 - The Power of Problem Mapping

Problem mapping empowers us to view complex challenges in a fresh light. By breaking them down into smaller, manageable components, we find clarity and focus. Moreover, we uncover new connections, narrow in on the specific parts of the problem that need our attention, or unearth new insights. A problem map is an asset you can revisit, test ideas against, and use to guide your journey to a solution.

In the next chapter of our series, we’ll turn our discovered insights into problem statements. Problem statements guide our design process and lead us to better potential solutions.
