**Trying This Out**: This may be the first time you’re interacting with the idea of wicked questions. You will inevitably be asked something about simplifying things or making them less complicated. I believe the language around this can be a barrier — and so the introduction of simple, complicated, and wicked or
complex problems is really important! Don’t underestimate the importance of getting everyone participating on the same page. The pushback on engaging with wicked questions often comes from an inability to imagine a fix. Remember that we’re so prone to solving problems, to come up with solutions
quickly, and then be convinced that we’re right — is the exact reason we don’t solve these problems.
