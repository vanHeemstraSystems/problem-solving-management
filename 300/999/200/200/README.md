**Trying This Out**: This may be the first time you’re interacting with the idea of wicked questions. You will inevitably be asked something about simplifying things or making them less complicated. I believe the language around this can be a barrier — and so the introduction of simple, complicated, and wicked or
complex problems is really important! Don’t underestimate the importance of getting everyone participating on the same page. The pushback on engaging with wicked questions often comes from an inability to imagine a fix. Remember that we’re so prone to solving problems, to come up with solutions
quickly, and then be convinced that we’re right — is the exact reason we don’t solve these problems.

## 200 - Workshop Steps

### Introduction (10 minutes)

Begin the workshop by introducing the concepts of simple, complicated, and wicked problems and distributing the downloadable or printable handout. Highlight the idea of reframing questions to tackle complex challenges effectively.

Encourage participants to introduce themselves to their team members and foster a positive team dynamic.

### What’s Your Complicated Focus Question? (15 minutes)

You’re going to do this workshop when you have a complicated problem or question in front of you. Share that question (this is likely something you’ve been working on or thinking about). Starting solo, have each member of the group write a list of “yeah, but…” ideas. Timebox this activity to five minutes.
Ask participants to share and clarify their ideas. Write each one on a sticky note. Don’t discuss or debate, seek clarity and write them down.

### Reframe to a Wicked Question (20 minutes)

Present the concept of wicked questions and their role in addressing complex challenges. Remind the group how wicked questions embrace uncertainty, interconnectedness, and diverse perspectives. Provide examples of reframed wicked questions based on the complicated questions shared by the
groups. Divide the team into smaller groups or pairs. Instruct each group to collaboratively reframe the given complicated question into a wicked question. Encourage creative thinking, exploration of various perspectives, and consideration of broader implications.

### Reflection and Discussion (10 minutes)

Have each group present their wicked question to the entire team.

Do a feedback round, and ask the group:
1. What do you like in the wicked questions being asked?
2. What feels difficult or uncomfortable?
3. Do any of the questions feel like they do a better job capturing the complexity? Why?
4. What are some of the broader implications of working on these questions?
5. What are the next 3 things we can do to explore possible solutions? What do we need to know? Who is experiencing the problem, and can we ask them about it?

### Closing and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

Summarize the key takeaways from the workshop. Express appreciation to the team for their participation and engagement. Remind them that this is new and the more everyone looks for the wickedness in complex problems, the better and faster the team will get at solving the problem.

The workshop helps the team with the understanding and a technique to reframe complicated questions into wicked questions, empowering them to approach complex challenges with a more adaptive and collaborative mindset. By embracing the wicked problem approach, the team can navigate ambiguity and foster innovative solutions that address the interconnectedness and diversity of perspectives inherent in wicked problems.

To effectively address wicked problems, organizations can reframe their problem questions to gain fresh perspectives and foster creative thinking. Let's explore how reframing common workplace problem questions can lead to better solutions.

### 1. Complicated Problem Question: "How can we improve employee productivity?"

Yeah, but not everyone works the same way. Yeah, but the question makes it seem like everyone isn’t productive. Yeah productivity is important, but is there value in focusing on motivation and employee empowerment?

**Reframed Wicked Problem Question**: *"How can we create a work environment that motivates and empowers employees to excel, considering individual needs, aspirations, and diverse work styles?"*

By reframing the question, organizations recognize that productivity is not solely about task completion but also about employee well-being and engagement. The wicked problem question acknowledges the complexity of human factors and the need for tailored strategies.

### 2. Complicated Problem Question: "What is the best marketing strategy to increase sales?"

**Reframed Wicked Problem Question**: *"How can we build a marketing strategy that resonates with our diverse customer base and adapts to changing market trends, while maintaining our brand identity and values?"*

The wicked problem question addresses the dynamic nature of marketing and acknowledges the importance of continuously aligning strategies with customer preferences and market fluctuations vs just seeking a set of tactics.

### 3. Complicated Problem Question: "What technologies should we invest in to streamline operations?"

**Reframed Wicked Problem Question**: *"How can we create a technology plan that optimizes efficiency while considering our limited resources, employees' skills, and potential risks associated with rapid technological advancements?"*

The wicked problem question acknowledges that technology decisions go beyond simply adopting the latest trends and must be mindful of resource constraints and the organization's unique context.
