# 100 - Section 1

## 100 - Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of organizational challenges, some problems are straightforward, while others seem almost impossible to solve. Brenda Zimmerman, a renowned scholar on complexity, introduced 
 the concept of complicated versus wicked problems. Understanding the differences between these two types of problems can provide invaluable insights for organizations seeking effective solutions.

Issues like employee engagement, improving company culture, or fostering innovation often fall into the category of **wicked problems**, though they’re often posed as **complicated questions**. These problems resist simple fixes and require holistic approaches that embrace the complexity of human interactions, values, and goals.

Learning to reframe complicated problems into wicked or complex questions allows us to look at these issues through a human-centred lens, and leads to better solutions along the way.

## 200 - Simple Problems

In the context of organizational problem-solving, a simple problem might be a minor technical issue that arises and can be resolved by following standard operating procedures or guidelines. These
problems are not complex and can be addressed without significant analysis or collaboration. In essence, simple problems are like puzzles with a single correct answer, and their solutions are readily
accessible to those with the necessary knowledge and skills.

## 300 - Complicated versus Wicked Problems

**Complicated problems** have clear-cut solutions and defined steps to reach them. A complicated problem might be a collection of simple problems. For instance, getting a rocket into space requires a
lot of steps, a lot of people, perfect weather conditions on the day of launch, but we know what success looks like because there is an understood and defined answer. In contrast, **wicked problems** are far more challenging to define, and their solutions are often elusive. Wicked problems are characterized by ambiguity, interconnectedness, and conflicting perspectives. They may have multiple root causes and no single solution. The example often used is raising children. What works for one kid, may not work for another — and — what used to work for one kid, can seemingly stop working entirely!

## 400 - Complexity in Organizational Problems

Organizations frequently encounter wicked problems due to their intricate structures, diverse stakeholders, and ever-changing environments. Issues like employee engagement, improving company
culture, or fostering innovation often fall into the category of wicked problems. These problems resist simple fixes and require holistic approaches that embrace the complexity of human interactions, values, and goals.

We often reduce problems to very narrow “complicated questions”. The nature of the question suggests an answer is clear-cut and would produce steps to reach a solution. But how often have you thought, *“yeah, but … ?”*
