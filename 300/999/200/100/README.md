## 100 - Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of organizational challenges, some problems are straightforward, while others seem almost impossible to solve. Brenda Zimmerman, a renowned scholar on complexity, introduced 
 the concept of complicated versus wicked problems. Understanding the differences between these two types of problems can provide invaluable insights for organizations seeking effective solutions.

Issues like employee engagement, improving company culture, or fostering innovation often fall into the category of wicked problems, though theyâ€™re often posed as complicated questions. These problems resist simple fixes and require holistic approaches that embrace the complexity of human interactions, values, and goals.

Learning to reframe complicated problems into wicked or complex questions allows us to look at these issues through a human-centred lens, and leads to better solutions along the way.
